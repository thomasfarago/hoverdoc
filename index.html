			<p>Music 1.0 really started when engineers<span class="hover-img" file-img="gottfried.png"></span> said, “To hell with the larynx’s limitations.”</p>
			<p>Then external pipe <span class="hover-img" file-img="https://image.ibb.co/h95PMc/organ.jpg">organs</span>,
			[43 HARPSICHORDS], and then
			[44 PIANOS] became things that were cool.

			Aided by these newfangled keyboarded contraptions, we’d find the [45 odd dude] with a prolific connection-making brain, and [46 he’d be really] good at harmonizing with himself. [47 These instigative brains’ musings] manifested in intricate air pressure waves — which confirmed delightful breakthroughs [48 when they raced back] through the exteroceptors attached to those brains. Their ears.

			[49 “Oh yeah!”] Went those brains. Everyone else’s brain got these connections second-hand, and they’d go, [50, what a musical genius!”]

			There were two major problems to solve.

			[51 “What if those genius connection-making brains are far away?”]

			- and -

			[52 “What if those genius connection-making brains are dead?”]

			Were two problems, but they weren’t both of the major problems. They were just two sides to the same coin that was the first - and obvious - problem.

			The other problem was “How is that genius connection-making fostered?” When I first heard my piano teacher muse that, “the great composers and pianists are to be looked at as exceptional flowers in a garden, put there by some force from above,” I asked him:

			[53 “How do we grow those flowers?”]

			He had no answer. Nobody did.

			This other problem had no strong economic forcing function pushing hard to resolve it. Some people would say it still doesn’t, but those people aren’t prescient when it comes to [54 the very economy- and humanity-demolishing AI looming ahead.]

			Hot on the heels of [55 Gutenberg’s press] came a kind of a solution to the “What if they’re dead and gone?!” problem: mass-produced sheet music. An invention that would simultaneously enable the greats to live on, but also sow the seeds of a gargantuan delay in resolving the other problem, thus preventing countless would-be greats from ever being born.

			[56 The publishers of sheet music] saw resounding success in Music Industry 1.0.

			So too did [57 composers] of sheet music, especially when it was both catchy and easily-playable. Scott Joplin, the composer of this piece, lived the rest of his life off royalties from a single tune called the Maple Leaf Rag - my first warhorse of a piece.

			Lastly - the [58 piano makers] were the enablers for all this. Piano-makers were everywhere. The families who made really nice ones, like the Steinways, got filthy rich.</p>

			[59 Thirty years later, Ice 2.0 - Ice factory.]

			Now you froze water centrally.
			Now - it didn’t have to be winter.
			You didn’t have to be in a cold city.
			You could have an ice factory in San Diego.
			You could have an ice factory in Hawaii.
			You could have an ice factory in Mumbai.
			It could be any place!

			Music Industry 2.0 started - again - with engineers who made sound-recording and -reproducing contrivances. [60 Starting with Edison]. Now the genius connection-making brains’ sounds could be disembodied. There was the phonograph, and the first piano rolls — and then — in 1896, an Italian college student named [61 Guglielmo Marconi] perfected a wireless transmitter.

			By 1910, piano sales peaked at over a thousand a day. Though phonograph sales were picking up, piano sales in 1914 were still comfortably in the lead. Important to note as well is that [62 self-playing pianos] were all the rage. At one point, they would make up over half of all piano sales. Basking in sound generated by a human whose “playing” was a product of the sheet music plus piano lessons formula was understandably less enticing than basking in the sounds of disembodied artists. Getting those genius connections into one’s brain second-hand was best done without having to siphon attention away to performances that were uninspiring, mistake-filled, and limited in terms of the repertoire variety.

			By 1915, an ambitious young commercial manager named [63 David Sarnoff] wrote a memo to his bosses at the American Marconi Company, saying, “[64 let’s sell those] wireless transmitters as music boxes for homes. They could replace [65 pianos] and [66 phonographs].” His bosses were like, “[67 PFF] That won’t happen. Radio is point to point, not point to mass.”

			By 1919, piano sales were dwarfed by phonograph sales, and it wasn’t long before radio sales dwarfed phonograph sales. Sarnoff was vindicated. Radio was point to mass. His employer, [68 RCA], led the way as the nation’s number one radio brand. At the twist of a knob - and cheaper than phonographs and records, and pianos (particularly Steinways), radios were found in two-thirds of US households by 1933. Portable music devices eventually came along - [69 tape players], [70 CD players], [71 MP3 players] that [72 got a lot better] and now we’re streaming music [73 straight to smartphones.]

			… and this might seem cutting-edge.

			Music Industry 3.0 perhaps?

			Not at all - that hasn’t yet begun, because no giant is seeing it yet.

			There’s [74 Apple], led by Tim “not Steve Jobs” Cook, with Apple Music as a loss leader, and it’s not really a big deal yet, because it helps sell their mobile devices. However, Apple’s Jimmy Iovine is right when he says, “I just don’t think streaming is enough as it is. Things won’t be okay just because Apple came into streaming and the numbers went up.”

			There’s [75 Amazon], led by Jeff “not in orbit” Bezos, with Amazon Music, who hopes to uppercut competitors by undercutting their pricing (who’d a thunk, it?) It’s also a loss leader, but also not really a big deal, but less of a ‘not really a big deal’ as Apple’s, because with respect to Amazon‘s consumer hardware plan — as far as it goes — they’re banking on their immobile device Echo, with its Alexa and “her” AI, taking off in as revolutionary a manner as the iPhone once did.

			There’s [76 Google], led by Sundar “AI is more profound than electricity or fire” Pichai, who is really ignoring the shockingly shocking and flagrantly conflagrant possibilities inherent in the development of that AI, and by doing so, he’s really living up to his surname, going balls to the wall when he chooses to publicly PI(T)CH AI. As far as the music plan goes, Google is just kinda copying Apple and Amazon’s strategies.

			There’s [77 Spotify], led by Daniel “Most Powerful Person In Music” Ek, who hasn’t yet been powerful enough to eke out profit, and speaking of ‘eke’, his last name might soon be pronounced that way.

			There’s [78 TIDAL], led and largely owned by JAY ‘hyphen’ Z, one of the greatest rappers ever, and that happened without a pen… [THE WATCHER 2] … and he just added the hyphen back into his name - but will have a harder time removing the hyphen-minus symbol appended to the front of the red ink bottom-line number on TIDAL’s balance sheet.

			Then there’s the rest - also not profitable - like [79 Pandora], [80 Deezer], and [81 Soundcloud], which just got a debt round.

			So, they’re all hemorrhaging billions… to the [82 big three record labels]. It makes sense though. The labels symbiotically merge with the artists, doing all the menial stuff that the artists don’t want to - or can’t easily - do(… yet). With artists being both altruistic and very amenable to labels’ shock-and-awe tactics out of the gate, these labels easily obtain invaluable music licensing rights, giving them the wherewithal to domineer the streaming services’ expenditures.

			The only big cat who isn’t in textbook streaming is [83 Facebook], but Mark just cut a big check to UMG. Attempting to do whatever he can to keep people on his platforms, he’s allowing Facebook and Instagram users to post homemade video clips that have segments of UMG songs in the background. No more enraging takedown notices. Universal gets a bunch of new revenue from that check. Probably an advance for a multiyear deal.

			How do we think about all this? The best way to look at this whole situation is that it’s truly a testament to music - perhaps humanity’s biggest obsession - that streaming companies and their investors are willing to keep hemorrhaging billions to get people their favorite music wherever, whenever. Streaming services are talking about being on the cusp of profitability, but while they say that they’re banking on a better future, they don’t yet know what that looks like.

			That’s because -

			[84 Customers] usually cannot tell you what they want. You have to have your vision; your passion; you have to jump ahead of them.

			They way to jump ahead of them is to get to the next curve; the action - the true action - the great innovation in the world doesn’t occur on the curve you are on. It occurs on the next curve.

			[84.a] “ICE 3.0: REFRIGERATOR CURVE.
			Now - the ice man didn’t have to deliver ice to your house!
			You didn’t have to go to the ice factory to get your ice.
			You had your own personal ice factory in your house called a refrigerator.”

			The advent of Music Industry 3.0 will naturally depend on engineers - working in concert to introduce the paradigm shift that’ll see our dependence on other brains’ genius connection-making lessen. The lesson known as the old ‘teach someone to fish’ trick, but super-tricked-out for the 21st century.

			Among the barriers are seven filtering fallacies perpetuated by music teachers. They’ll get belabored a bit later, but right now - we’ll run through five minutes’ worth of synopses for your synapses. Afterward, we’ll get into the undertakings that’ll enable the public to intuitively fell these fallacies themselves.

			Without further ado, let’s get in to it so that you too can intuit that:

			[85 “Absolutely this is what will happen.”]

			[86 1) “Reading music is necessary,” the teachers say.]

			Oh? Just as it’s necessary for you to do all your dialoging with text? Context truly matters, dear teacher. Notwithstanding the fact that the vast majority of earnings in the music industry go to - and have gone to - non-readers, let’s say that the reading demands have come from your students (though they almost never do).

			Your classes, and the published books you use for them, rely upon the relic that is sheet music to foist splinter skills.

			In piano lessons, for example, you’re doing wrong what the throngs of YouTube videos are doing wrong by showing top-down camera angles of keyboards and fingers.

			You’re not only instilling dependence on the score, but you’re ensuring that [87 the dominant system] facilitating the so-called ‘playing’ is an open loop system.

			Also - to varying degrees, the [88 closed-loop system using the ears] gets pushed way off to the side by that open loop system that relies upon the eyes to make limbs and extremities fire blindly - or shall I say - deaf-ly - and definitely not deftly enough.

			[89 2) “Classical music is fundamentally different than pop music] - therefore, it must be treated and learned differently,” the teachers say. 
			No, there is no dividing line separating old organized sound derived from - and eliciting - emotion, from new organized sound that accomplishes the same thing. When delving into the lives of the composers whose music constitutes the written classical canon that your classes rely upon, we’ll see that those composers’ early lives mirrored those of the musicians who you’re dismissing as “pop”.

			[90 3) “Emphasis must be placed on learning proper technique.”
			 No, the technical exercises and the pieces of music that you’re assigning to your students are exercises in preparatory locomotion that enable mimicry of the ability to truly play the instrument.

			You foster painstaking assimilation of noisy arrays of nerve impulses via [91 conscious proprioception] - implicit procedural muscle memories for each piece.

			Communication between the joint receptors, through the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway to the cerebrum, ending in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex, is what enables the refining of voluntary movements.

			What you should be enabling is the effortless expression of profound musical thoughts - signals - and this only happens when the brain rapidly and subconsciously does inferential mapping of the instrument’s interface and uses [92 non- or unconscious proprioception] - [92a a feedforward control system] - to send extremities flying to the right places to manifest those signals. This subsystem uses the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts, which interface directly with the cerebellum. You’re getting kids to very consciously hijack their nervous systems, supplanting the one right subsystem with the one wrong one.

			Your marketing ploys called ‘recitals’ and your quality control tests called ‘exams’ have self-conscious kids with trembly-hands humiliated as parts of their brains, indifferent to their hapless owners’ wishes, go ‘fuck this’ and mercilessly abandon those noisy nerve impulse arrays.

			Just stage fright? No - it seems like, to some extent, four buttons have been replaced with 88 keys, four tones with twelve, and an incrementing random sequence with an often-boring signal to mimic, in what we could call a souped-up version of [93 the retro game Simon].

			Also - why might the student be able to [94 sing] the melody eluding their trembly hands?

			It may seem right to you to task students with incremental assimilation of movements via eyes and conscious proprioception, followed by not-quite-fully-closed-loop whittling and refining via ears (or, as you say, “getting it under your fingers and then adding the emotion”). Why is it though, that — after years of making efforts to mimic signals they adore listening to recordings of — the students encounter inevitable ceilings to their prowess?

			The next-level coordination is elusive because you started things off the wrong way on the first day. Also - the student can’t generate their own signal, because why, dear teacher?

			[95 4) “Composers’ perfect pitch led to their compositional ability.”]

			Oh? What about the great composers who didn’t have it? — and shouldn’t [96 East Asia], where perfect pitch is nine times more prevalent, see that many more great composers? Knowing the label names for the notes of this solo would help you make it how? A first principles analysis of this phenomenon is desperately needed, and you’ve got it coming.

			Included will be a refutation of:

			5) “People with perfect pitch are born with it,”

			This intellectually lazy yet super-widespread assertion claims the physically impossible! Our easy-to-follow reasoning, plus another neuroscientist’s observations backing it up, will indicate that this is sheer fallacy.

			[97 6) “You have to do ear training and learn music theory,”] teachers say.

			No. In a nutshell, ‘training your ear’ is nothing but the absorption of trivial artificial associations. As for theory… linguistic study does not a poet make.

			[98a 7) “Improvisation is something you do if you want to study jazz,”] teachers say.

			Ahhhhh no! All the composers whose music constitutes your “classical training” canon were legendary improvisers, and known for that, not what was referred to as their ‘stale’ or ‘pale’ sheet music. Improvisation is a process that they were all reverent of and deferential to. It was like - [98b crack] for them.

			Now it is true that jazz schools are built on improvisation classes, where students are bombarded with information such as chord progressions, scales, and licks - which are stock patterns and phrases; short series of agreeable notes to be used in accompaniment and in melodic lines of solos.

			It might seem harmless, but it’s not. It’s nefarious and super-insidious. A [99 wolf in sheep’s clothes]. While the aforementioned preparatory locomotion exercises inherently involve mimicked signal conveyance riding on the precarious coattails of nervous noise regurgitation, these theoretical teachings - designed to serve players while they’re performing - are exercises in [100 preparatory reasoning that unfailingly supplant intuition!]

			My friend Matt, who was accepted into the prestigious Humber College Jazz Program in Toronto, said:

			[101 “Thomas, if you are finding a way to escape the box of theory while improvising, that is really rad. That’s like the ultimate goal for improvisers.”]

			[102 A Las Vegas-based jazz teacher named Rich Pulin said:]

			“Prior to learning theory, which included methods for chord changes and all of the different scales, my ear carried me to wonderful improvisational places! After absorbing a great amount of theoretical information, I’d say that my jazz improvising skills diminished from the point when I relied solely on my evidently wonderful ear. This was how I was affected. Still, always a dependable jazz soloist, but missing those little strokes of ‘genius’ that I was told that I exhibited in the earlier days.”

			[103 Now, teachers, you might throw up your hands and say something like, “Well - true musical improvisation is an impenetrable skill based very much on instantaneous intuition, inspiration and insight!”]

			A skill based on insight? Right! Inspiration? Right! Intuition? Right! Instantaneous? Right! Impenetrable?! Wrong!

			Improvisation is the law. You’re breaking it. The foundation upon which your house is built has started to crack. We could debate you until the cows come home, but we know you’re not going to [104 stop trying to make your profit].

			So - that bubble of yours? It’s going to make like the post-classical musicians you dismiss, because [105 we’re vying to POP it.]

			[106 Like the Hindenburg]

			[107 getting impaled by a friggin’ bird.]

			A Falcon

			[108 9 rocket.]

			[109 - Hindenburg]

			* * *

			[110 “What you want to aim for is monopoly,”]

			And we will get there, because - [111 The very interesting fact is that none of the ice harvesters became ice factories, and none of the ice factories became refrigerator companies, and why is that? It’s because most organizations define themselves in terms of what they already do.]

			Before we get a neuroscientist to start us off on the underpinning secret - which is the axiom - that all of this is built upon, let’s skim over the five undertakings necessary in order to attain this monopoly.
